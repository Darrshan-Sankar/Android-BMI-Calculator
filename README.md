# Android-BMI-Calculator
Hi I made this project using the platform <b> Coursera
</b>.
<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>XML
<li>Java
<li>Android Development
<br>during the course, and everything was explained fine.
I enjoyed this guided project, you can as well. To register for the guided project, visit:
